| Source | [github.com/nedap/archetype-languageserver](https://github.com/nedap/archetype-languageserver) |

**What it is:** A VS Code extension that adds ADL 1.4 and ADL 2 syntax highlighting, validation, and AQL editing support.

**Who should use it:** Developers who use VS Code and want to edit archetypes or write AQL queries without switching to a browser-based tool.

## openEHR SDK

| Available from | [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ehrbase/openEHR_SDK/releases) |
| Source | [github.com/ehrbase/openEHR_SDK](https://github.com/ehrbase/openEHR_SDK) |

**What it is:** A Java SDK for working with openEHR artefacts: parsing and serialising compositions, working with templates, and building AQL queries. EHRbase uses it internally.

## oehrpy

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Active (alpha) |
| Cost | Free (Apache 2.0) |
| Open source | Yes |
| Language | Python |
| Owner and developer | [platzhersh](https://github.com/platzhersh) |
| Available from | [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/oehrpy/) (`pip install oehrpy`) |
| Source | [github.com/platzhersh/oehrpy](https://github.com/platzhersh/oehrpy) |
| Documentation | [oehrpy.dev](https://oehrpy.dev/) |

**What it is:** A Python SDK for openEHR. It provides Pydantic models for the Reference Model 1.1.0, template-specific composition builders, FLAT and canonical JSON serialisation, a fluent AQL builder, an OPT parser and validator, and an async REST client for EHRbase.

**Who should use it:** Python developers building applications, data pipelines, or scripts against an openEHR CDR who want typed RM objects and IDE autocomplete instead of hand-assembling composition JSON. Its REST client and FLAT format support currently target EHRbase 2.26 and later.

## Archie

| Source | [github.com/openEHR/archie](https://github.com/openEHR/archie) |

**What it is:** A Java library implementing the openEHR Reference Model and an ADL 2 parser. EHRbase uses it as its RM implementation.

## ADL2 Core Libraries

| Source | [github.com/openEHR/adl2-core](https://github.com/openEHR/adl2-core) |

**What it is:** A Java-based reference implementation of the ADL 2.0 and AOM specifications, open-sourced by Marand.

## FHIR Bridge

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Source available; release and support status unclear |
| Cost | Free (Apache 2.0) |
| Open source | Yes |
| Current owner | [vitagroup](https://www.vitagroup.ag/) |
| Original author | [EHRbase project](https://www.ehrbase.org/) |
| Available from | [github.com/vitagroupag/fhir-bridge](https://github.com/vitagroupag/fhir-bridge) |
| Source | [github.com/vitagroupag/fhir-bridge](https://github.com/vitagroupag/fhir-bridge) |

**What it is:** A broker between HL7 FHIR clients and an openEHR server, specifically EHRbase. It allows FHIR-speaking applications to read and write data to an openEHR CDR.

## openFHIR

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Status | Active |
| Cost | Free (Apache 2.0) open-source edition; commercial Enterprise edition |
| Open source | Yes |
| Platform | Java / Docker |
| Owner and developer | [openFHIR](https://open-fhir.com/) |
| Available from | [GitHub releases](https://github.com/openFHIR/openFHIR/releases/latest) and [openFHIR sandbox](https://sandbox.open-fhir.com/) |
| Source | [github.com/openFHIR/openfhir](https://github.com/openFHIR/openfhir) |

**What it is:** An engine that implements the FHIR Connect specification for bidirectional mapping between openEHR compositions and HL7 FHIR resources. It translates data without storing the clinical data itself. The commercial Enterprise edition adds production capabilities including authentication, terminology integration, multitenancy, operational-template synchronization, and performance optimizations.

**Who should use it:** Teams evaluating declarative, specification-based mappings between openEHR and FHIR systems. The project explicitly states that its open-source edition is not intended for production use because it lacks authentication, role-based access control, terminology integration, and other production capabilities; production users should assess the Enterprise edition or provide equivalent controls themselves.
